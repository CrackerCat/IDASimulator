		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<div id="intro">
			<p>
				IDASim is an IDAPython module that supports simple simulation / replacement of executable code
				with Python code.
				Pesky details such as allocating memory space for strings and data, accessing function arguments, 
				and setting return values are all handled by IDASim.
			</p>

			<p>
				IDASim is especially useful for:

				<ul>
					<li>Simulating library function calls when emlating <a href="http://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1588.shtml">code snippets</a> in IDA</li>
					<li>Simulating function calls that fail on your machine due to <a href="http://www.devttys0.com/2012/03/emulating-nvram-in-qemu/">missing/incorrect hardware</a> or variations in environments</li>
					<li>Easily changing the functionality of a code block by dynamically modifying registers / memory values</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h1>Using IDASim</h1>
		<div id="usage">
			<p>
				To use IDASim, you must:

				<ol>
					<li>Import the idasim Python module</li>
					<li>Create function handlers to replace existing functions in the running process</li>
					<li>Instantiate the <a href="idasim.html">IDASim</a> class object</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h2>Simulating Functions</h2>
			<p>
				Suppose we have a target binary which contains the following internal function:
			
				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		<span class="green">void</span> trace(<span class="green">int</span> trace_level, <span class="green">char</span> *format_string, ...);
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

				This function is used to display dynamically generated debug information, and is called repeatedly throughout 
				the code. However, the contents of this function were #defined out during the production build of our target, 
				so none of this information ever gets displayed. We can change that:

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		<span class="purple">from</span> idasim <span class="purple">import</span> *

		<span class="gold">def</span> <span class="aqua">mytrace</span>(trace_level, format_string=<span class="red">''</span>):
			<span class="aqua">print</span> sim.vsprintf(format_string, <span class="red">2</span>)
			<span class="gold">return</span> <span class="red">0</span>

		sim = IDASim(handlers={<span class="red">'trace'</span> : mytrace})
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

				Here, we've told IDASim that we want all calls to the function named 'trace' redirected to our handler function, mytrace().
				Note that <span class="red">the class instace must be assigned a global name</span>, in this case 'sim', even if it is not 
				subsequently referenced by your script.
				<br /><br />

				The mytrace handler defines the first two arguments for the function (the rest are obviously variable arguments): trace_level 
				and format_string. Since we know that the second argument, format_string, will be a pointer to a NULL-terminated string, we've 
				defined the default value for format_string as a string type. This means that instead of being passed the raw value for the 
				format_string argument (a pointer to the NULL-terminated format string), the actual format string will be passed to mytrace.
				<br /><br />

				Format string parsing can typically be handled by the built in IDASim.vsprintf() method. We pass the format_string as the first argument to
				IDASim.vsprintf(), and also tell it that the format string arguments start at function argument index 2 (i.e., the third argument
				to the trace function will be the first format string argument).
				<br /><br />

				IDASim.vsprintf() will return the formatted string, so we simply print that out to the IDA console and return 0. The
				return register will be automatically populated with our return value, and execution of the process will jump back
				to the return address specified by the caller.
			</p>
		<!--	<hr /> -->

			<h2 id="handlers">Returning String/Data Pointers</h2>
			<p>
				What about handlers that need to return string/data pointers? Let's see what would be needed to simulate libc's strdup():

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		<span class="gold">def</span> <span class="aqua">mystrdup</span>(string=<span class="red">''</span>):
			<span class="gold">return</span> string + <span class="red">"\x00"</span>
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

				When a handler returns a string type, that string data gets placed into the running process's memory, the return
				register is populated with a pointer to the data, and process execution is transferred back to the caller's return address.
				<br /><br />

				Note that since strdup() needs to return a NULL terminated string, the handler function needs to ensure that a NULL byte 
				is placed at the end of the string that it returns.
			</p>
		<!--	<hr /> -->

			<h2>Controlling Execution Flow</h2>
			<p>
				OK, but what if we only want to simulate a function under specific circumstances? Each function handler can control if the
				original function is executed or not. If a handler returns None, nothing further is done and the process continues execution normally:

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		<span class="gold">def</span> <span class="aqua">myhandler</span>():
			<span class="gold">if</span> sim.cpu.ReturnAddress() == <span class="red">0x0040BAAD</span>:
				<span class="gold">return</span> <span class="aqua">None</span>
			<span class="gold">else</span>:
				<span class="gold">return</span> <span class="red">0</span>
				</blockquote>
				</pre>
			</p>

			<p>
				Handlers can also directly control where the process continues its execution from by raising a JumpTo or GoTo exception:

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		<span class="gold">def</span> <span class="aqua">gotohandler</span>():
			<span class="gold">raise</span> GoTo(<span class="red">0x0040BAAD</span>)

		<span class="gold">def</span> <span class="aqua">jumptohandler</span>():
			<span class="gold">raise</span> JumpTo(<span class="red">8</span>)
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

				In the above example, gotohandler() causes process execution to continue from the address 0x0040BAAD. By contrast, jumptohandler()
				causes the process execution to continue from the current program counter address plus 8 bytes.
			</p>

			<h2>Starting the Debugger</h2>
			<p>
				If the debug or attach arguments to IDASim() are set to true, the IDASim class constructor will respectively attempt to automatically 
				start the debugger or attach to a remote debugger before returning:
	
				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		sim = IDASim(debug=<span class="aqua">True</span>)
		sim = IDASim(attach=<span class="aqua">True</span>)
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

				This is especially useful if you wish to automate the initialization of memory / registers before debugging the target process.
				The IDASim class provides various methods for allocating strings, integers, or raw data in process memory. As an example, let's
				use IDASim to configure the argc and argv arguments when running the main() function of a target binary as a code snippet:

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		sim = IDASim(debug=<span class="aqua">True</span>)
		sim.cpu.Argument(<span class="red">0</span>, value=<span class="red">2</span>)
		sim.cpu.Argument(<span class="red">1</span>, value=sim.ARGV([<span class="red">'./foo'</span>, <span class="red">'bar'</span>]))
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

				This uses the Architecture.Argument() method for setting the values of the main function's first argument (argc) and second argument (argv).
				Note that the special IDASim.ARGV() method is used for allocating space for the argv strings and generating an array of pointers to 
				those strings.
			</p>
		<!--	<hr /> -->

			<h2 id="mmu">Memory Management</h2>
			<p>
				The IDASim class provides various methods for allocating data in process memory. Strings, integers and raw data can be placed directly
				into process memory using the following methods (where applicable, endianess is handled automatically):

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		sim.String(<span class="red">"Put this string in memory and ensure it is NULL terminated."</span>)
		sim.Word(<span class="red">0x0040BAAD</span>)
		sim.HalfWord(<span class="red">0xBAAD</span>)
		sim.Byte(<span class="red">0xAD</span>)
		sim.Malloc(<span class="red">"\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05"</span>)
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

				When allocating space for strings / data, IDASim needs to have some memory available where it can place data without interfering with
				the memory used by the running process. By default, IDASim looks for a segment of memory named 'MMU' to use. If this does not exist
				it looks to see if the last segment of memory is named 'MEMORY' or 'RAM', and if so, uses that. Else, it will begin allocating data 
				from the bottom of the stack segment. If this also fails, it will default to using a base address of 0x100000.
				<br /><br />
				While this usually works fine, you may need to explicitly specify a memory segment to use in order to ensure data integrity. This can be 
				done by defining a memory segment named 'MMU', or by passing the start address to use for data storage to the IDASim class constructor:

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		sim = IDASim(membase=<span class="red">0x0040BAAD</span>)
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

		<h1 id="porting">Porting</h1>
		<div id="ports">
			<p>
				 To add support for a new architecture, add a new entry to the Architecture.ARCH dictionary:

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		ARCH = {

			...
	
			<span class="blue"># Dictionary key is the architecture name</span>
			<span class="red">'mips'</span>  : {
				<span class="blue"># Offset from the stack pointer where function arguments start</span>
				<span class="red">'spoffset'</span>      : <span class="red">0x10</span>,
				<span class="blue"># Registers used to pass function arguments</span>
				<span class="red">'argreg'</span>        : [<span class="red">'a0'</span>, <span class="red">'a1'</span>, <span class="red">'a2'</span>, <span class="red">'a3'</span>],
				<span class="blue"># Register(s) used to store function return values</span>
				<span class="red">'retval'</span>        : [<span class="red">'v0'</span>, <span class="red">'v1'</span>],
				<span class="blue"># Name of the stack pointer register</span>
				<span class="red">'sp'</span>            : <span class="red">'sp'</span>,
				<span class="blue"># Name of the return address register</span>
				<span class="red">'ra'</span>            : <span class="red">'ra'</span>,
				<span class="blue"># Name of the program counter register</span>
				<span class="red">'pc'</span>            : <span class="red">'pc'</span>,
			},
	
			...
		}
				</pre>
				</blockquote>

				Note that any of the required values can be specified as pointer values if necessary. For example, in x86, the return
				address is not stored in a register, but rather pushed onto the stack such that the stack pointer register points
				to the return address on the stack at the beginning of any function. Thus, the value for the 'ra' key can be specified
				as '*ESP', indicating that the ESP register contains a pointer to the memory location where the return address is located.
				<br /><br />

				If your target architecture is supported but your specific target processor is not supported, all
				that is required is to add a new entry to Architecture.PROCESSORS dictionary:

				<blockquote>
				<pre>
		PROCESSORS = {

			...

			<span class="blue"># Dictionary key is the name of the IDA processory module</span>
			'mipsl' : [{
				<span class="blue"># The architecture key value, as specified in Architecture.ARCH</span>
				<span class="red">'architecture'</span>  : <span class="red">'mips'</span>,
				<span class="blue"># The endianess of this processor module, one of: 'little', 'big'</span>
				<span class="red">'endianess'</span>     : <span class="red">'little'</span>,
				<span class="blue"># The default bus width of this processory module</span>
				<span class="red">'bits'</span>          : <span class="red">32</span>
			}],

			...
		}
